# pandas

In the context of Python programming, "pandas" refers to the pandas library, 
which is a powerful and widely used library for data manipulation and analysis. 
Here's a brief overview of pandas:

Pandas Library:

Purpose: Pandas is designed to provide easy-to-use 
data structures and functions needed to manipulate and analyze 
structured data seamlessly.

Key Data Structures:

DataFrame: A two-dimensional table with rows and columns, 
similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.

Series: A one-dimensional array-like object representing a column or row in a DataFrame.
Key Features:

Data Cleaning: Pandas provides tools for handling missing data, reshaping, and cleaning datasets.

Data Exploration: You can easily explore and analyze datasets, 
compute descriptive statistics, and visualize data.

Data Transformation: Pandas allows for efficient data manipulation, merging, and reshaping.
Integration with Other Libraries: Pandas is often used in conjunction with other libraries like NumPy 
(for numerical operations) and Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization).
